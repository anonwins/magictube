# how it works

all you gotta do is type the song you want to listen to. hit enter. done.

magictube finds the most relevant video, downloads & saves its audio, and then plays it.

# why choose magictube

save memory, bandwidth, time, energy. think smart. it's the youtube experience, reimagined.

# who is this good for

when you want to build a music collection with your favourite songs, this is the easiest way i've ever thought of.

if you want to make a music folder for yourself or a friend, or you want to play songs without having to research them

# how to run

just type ./magictube and let the magic begin!

# dependencies

youtube-dl & curl. tested on ubuntu 21.04. should work pretty much everywhere.

# what about the future?

this is still very early version. there are things to be done, most importantly: 1) error handling, 2) searching & downloading timing optimizations.
