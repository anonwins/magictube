# magictube

A simple bash script that searches for a youtube video, downloads & saves its audio, and then plays it.

All you gotta do is type the song you want to listen to. Hit enter. Done. Also the song is saved in your disk.

Save memory, bandwidth, time, energy. Think smart. Think magictube. The tube experience, reimagined

**how to run**: just type ./magictube and let the magic begin!

**dependencies**: you need to have youtube-dl & curl for this script to work. it makes sense, right?
