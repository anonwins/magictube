# how does it work?

all you gotta do is type the song you want to listen to. hit enter. done.

magictube finds the most relevant video, downloads & saves its audio, and then plays it.

# why choose magictube?

save memory, bandwidth, time, energy. think smart. it's the youtube experience, reimagined.

# who is this good for?

when you want to build a music collection with your favourite songs, this is the easiest way i've ever thought of.

if you want to make a music folder for yourself or a friend, or you want to play songs without having to research them.

# how to run?

just type ***magictube*** and let the magic begin!

# requirements

you must have [**curl**](https://google.com/search?&q=install+curl+linux) and one of the following:

[**yt-dlp**](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) (recommended), or [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org), or [youtube-dlc](https://github.com/blackjack4494/yt-dlc).

tested on ubuntu 21.04. should work pretty much everywhere.

# how to install?

just put the file in ***/usr/local/bin***.

# new version 3.0

this is an important version. the timings have been greatly improved. now it all depends on your internet connection. also 3 different downloaders are supported. you can add more/select your choice in the config section. there are some checks, now it handles 404 results properly.. generally i would say this is a pretty stable version. good job, me! thanks. ok, enjoy have fun everybody :D
